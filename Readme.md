   npm install
   ```
4. Build the extension:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
5. The built extension will be in the `build/` directory

## Verification
- The build process generates identical output to the submitted extension
- All source files are in `src/`, `public/`, and root config files
- No obfuscated or proprietary code is used

## Notes
- This extension uses open-source tools: Vite, TypeScript, React
- No minification beyond standard bundling
- Source code is provided for full review and reproducibility

## Overview
DevNet Wallet is a browser extension designed for safe blockchain development and testing.  
It enables developers to interact with EVM and Solana test networks without risking mainnet assets.  
This project is intended strictly for **development and testing purposes only**.

## Build Instructions

1. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
````

2. **Build the extension**

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

3. **Locate the output**

   * The compiled extension will be in the `build/` directory.
   * When submitting to AMO, **zip only the contents** of the `build/` directory, not the folder itself.

     ```bash
     cd build
     zip -r ../devnet-wallet.zip *
     ```

## Review Notes

* No third-party binaries, obfuscated, or minified code is included beyond open-source dependencies.
* All source code, build scripts, and configuration files are provided for review and reproducibility.
* The build pipeline uses **TypeScript** and **Vite** to bundle and compile source files.
* No external network requests are made during the build process.

---

## Troubleshooting

* If the build fails, ensure correct Node.js and npm versions are installed.
* Verify that all referenced files in `manifest.json` (e.g., icons, HTML, JS) exist in the `build/` directory.
* Run `npm run clean` (if available) before rebuilding to ensure a clean state.
